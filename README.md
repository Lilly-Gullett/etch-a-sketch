# etch-a-sketch

This is a fun Etch-a-Sketch program that allows you to draw by hovering your mouse over the Etch-a-Sketch.
As with a real Etch-a-Sketch, you cannot pick up and draw somewhere else, everything will be connected.
Unlike a real Etch-a-Sketch, you have 5 different tools at your disposal to create your masterpiece:
    1 . The Color Tool gives you the option to draw in any color you'd like. Just click the black square and you will see an expansion where you can select your color.
    2 . The Shading Tool colors in black but at 10% opacity. If you run over a tile you already colored with the shading tool, it will go up to 20% opacity. Once a tile, is fully opaque with this tool, running over the tile again will reset the opacity to 10%.
    3 . The Color at Random Tool will randomly generate a new color for each tile, for that perfect patchwork-quilt look.
    4 . The Eraser Tool will reset the tiles your mouse runs over to white.
    5 . The Grid Slider allows you to adjust your detail level. If you want more pixelated art, you will want a lower grid size. Higher detail art will need a higher grid size. The grid size number given refers to the number of tiles available along both the width and the height. You may choose any size between a 16 x 16 grid to a 100 x 100 grid.
        -Use of this tool will erase your current work, so use it carefully.

But that is not all, when you clear the board using the 'Shake the Etch-a-Sketch!' option at the bottom, there will be a shaking animation that plays as Etch-a-Sketch clears.

I hope you have fun with this program!
